    "Before everything, even time, there was only one thing. Imos: owner of the universe. Nothing can happen out of it's will. But knowing everything can be too boring. Imos wanted to create a world which events would happen out of his will. So he created Itmars and wanted them to draw anything they imagine. They draw water, wind, earth, fire and lightning. But one of them wanted his drawing to be on top of all drawings. So he drew the darkness. Imos put the drawings together and gave them life. Thus was formed the Adelia.",
    "There was also things that Itmars didn't drew like humans, elfs, dwarfs, hobbits and other creatures. Imos created them to be natives of Adelia.",
    "But not before long The War of Elements has begun. Even power of all elements together weren't enough to suppress darkness. As darkness slowly conquer the Adelia many lost their life and many became a slave to darkness.",
    "Itmars knew it was going to be too late to save Adelia. So they decided to sacrifice elements as their last hope. Elements came together and put everything into this last attack. This togetherness formed the brighest light ever that will be called Soleis the Light of Life. Soleis shined brightly on lands of Adelia and suppress the darkness forever. Elements and their magical power spread all around the Adelia. Creating new life forms, races or effecting living beings with magic.",
    "Thus a long era of peace began.",
  ]),
  new LoreChapter(2, "Greed", [
    "Soleis, the Light of Life, enriched lands of Adelia giving hope to us, folks living on it. We built life from scracth. Farms, villages, towns, castles followed by kingdoms to rule Adelia.",
    "After a long time which The War of Elements only known as a legend, natives of Adelia started to forget the sacrifice that brought serenity to their lands.",
    "Not long after, our kings became a slave to their greed. They used their armies which was formed to protect the lands, to conquer them. Laid siege to every fortress, they bite and bite away.",
    'Men of the Adelia, we stand at the precipice. The kings have failed us and yet we do not plead? instead we wail "Why have the gods forsaken us?"',
    "The nefarious force, dark magic, began to be felt and consume life of Adelia again. Yet we did not banish it, instead studying the vile arcane for our own power and wealth!",
    "Can we chart a course back in to the light? Will we find the willpower to banish the darkness? Unite around light of elements?",
  ]),
  new LoreChapter(3, "Hope", [
    "The Adelia bleeds, flogged by war. The battles are the gods' whip, chastisement for our sins! And within this darkness, the monsters are back.. wandering freely.. More and more crowded as we get familiar with dark magic. Yet did we raise out swords against them? Or have we laid this burden on others?",
    "On so called The Guardians. Those who studied elements to bring Soleis back to cleanse Adelia again. The last stand against unholy relicts of this Darkness. Nigh is the time of the sword and axe! none will fight this war in our stead! Nigh is the time of madness and disdain!",
  ]),
  new LoreChapter(4, "Eternal Peace", [
    "Far away from the war at Adelia, there was a small elf village named Bera. The village folk were afraid but all they could do is hoping the war doesn’t reach them. But a child named Aleesia was more curious about magical lands of Adelia than she is afraid of war. She would escape and make small exploration trips whenever she can.",
    "One day the unholy relicts of this war, undeads, attacked Bera. It looked like there was no hope for the elf folks.. But Guardians made it in time! Slaying the undeads easily, elf town was saved. Aleesia were admired by guardians, strong warriors in shiny armours protecting her family, her village and all of Adelia. She worked hard to become a guardian, so she did. She earned guardians’ respect with her skills and leadership in combat and became Ranger General of Bera.",
    "But her glorious days were coming to an end. An undead army, never seen this big before, were charging towards Bera. Aleesia prepared The Guardians to defend her town. With her great skills, it was looking like Bera had a chance. But then he appeared on an undead horse, Makaph the King of Undeads. There was no guardian who can face him in combat. Aleesia charged forward to take him down but Makaph’s sword sliced through her.",
    "Her failure, represented by her own corpse, and the corpses strewn around her. The last moments of her life, captured in perfect, horrifying clarity – the moments that spurred every action she’s taken since. Her soul was captured by Makaph. She can’t move on. She can’t look back. She can simply exist, suspended forever in that one horrifying moment – the moment that should have been her demise, but was not.",
    "Makaph the King of Undeads continued to conquer Adelia with his army which is getting bigger and bigger by each death. The Guardians had to stop them before it is too late. They formed the most glorious army of Guardians ever. The Guardians fought good, testing power of Makaph in close combat. But Makaph was stronger than they can handle. The battle was lost but Makaph’s sword were broken which weakened his control over undeads. Thus Aleesia and a few strong souls who was killed by Makaph’s sword, gained control over their body.",
    "How much of Aleesia’s memory still exists? Enough that she remembers her family, and time before her death. But the most powerful memory – the moment she carries with her always — was that moment of her demise. And that is why, when given a choice to do anything at all, Aleesia immediately set out to have her revenge.",
    "It wasn’t just revenge that Aleesia was trying to accomplish. She was trying to undo everything Makaph had done. She gathered the other free-willed undead to her side, and gave them a banner to fight under. But it didn’t undo what Makaph had done. None of it did. When the Undead King fell, Aleesia went to his throne. Only to find another sitting on it, herself. Life is pain. Hope fails. She understand that even if they form Soleis again and restore peace, people can never maintain it. There will always be hatred, greed, stupidity to feed the Darkness.",
    "What, then, is Aleesia’s, the Undead Queen's, ultimate goal? It may very well be peace – but not the kind of peace everyone else imagines when they say the word. No, it’s the kind of peace that exists in a world without conflict. Without feeling. Without life. It’s the cold, absent grasp of undeath – unyielding and unchanging. Neither alive nor dead, simply existing, purposeless and unfeeling in an absence of want, need, or desire.",
